# FixSync – The Universal Service Portal That Actually Works

Customers drag photos + videos of their problem.  
Technicians jump in live, collaborate in real-time, and drop an exact quote — no unnecessary truck rolls.

Works for **plumbing, HVAC, electrical, roofing, auto repair, appliance repair… any trade**.

### Features
- Drag-and-drop photos + videos (mp4, mov, webm supported)
- Real-time chat room (customer can watch or join)
- Instant quote lock & send
- One shareable link = one job (no logins, no apps to install)
- 100 % private per job
- Deploy in 30 seconds on Streamlit Community Cloud

Perfect for:
- Solo techs who hate surprise jobs
- Companies that want to quote accurately before dispatching
- Customers who want to stop describing “that weird noise”

Zero backend. Zero database. Zero bullshit.
